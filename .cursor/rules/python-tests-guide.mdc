- Package source is in `Source/Packages`. The packages should be available to your environment.
- Tests are groped into **Test Plans** in `Tests/plan-name/`.
- Test plans themselves are named `plan.md` in the relevant test directory.
- When writing a test plan for a package or subpackage, take care to read the entire source first, to understand its structure and intended behaviour.
- Test scripts must sit in the same directory as `plan.md`, and should be split up and structured according to the plan's structure.
- The linter is **pylance**. Treat linter errors as test failures. When appropriate, you may explicitly ignore linter errors by appending `# type: ignore` to lines.
- Run the `pytest` command to run tests in the terminal.
- If the User asks you vaugely to "write tests" or "continue testing", use this procedure to work out what to do:
  - If there's no `plan.md`, write it (then STOP)
  - If test files exist, run them, and debug any failures (then STOP)
  - Find the next section of the plan that has no test file; write it, run it, then debug it (then STOP)
- Choose one small task to do, then STOP. Don't work on mulitple test files at once. Completing one small task well is better than trying to do everything and failing.
- Make your test code **simple**. Counterintuitively, it can take more effort, thinking, and revision to get a simpler product, so don't be afraid to spend some time simplifying.
